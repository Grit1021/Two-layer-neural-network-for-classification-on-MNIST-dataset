- Network.py
This is the Neural Network class. One can design and improve DNN models with it.

- plots.py
The function for plotting the training history which needs Matplotlib.

-train.py
It gives an example for training the model with Network.py and plotting the loss functions with plots.py. With a givn random seed, you can also obtain the result with 99.998% accuracy on the training dataset and 98.37% accuracy on the test dataset.
